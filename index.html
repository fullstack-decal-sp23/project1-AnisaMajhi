            <div class="grid-item"><h6>Product Management</h6>
                <p>Fall 2022 I joined Berkeley's only product-oriented club! Here, I went through the Fellowship 
                    training program to learn more about product fundamentals. 
                    Now, I'm working on a UI/UX project with Sega.

            <div class="grid-item"><h6>Future Business Leaders of America</h6>
                <p>One of my favorite high school clubs was FBLA! Here, I learned about business practices
                    in a hands-on manner through competitions and even national conferences!

        <h6>Reading</h6>
        <p>Whenever I catch myself waiting anywhere, I love to read. Webtoons and online comics make it
            easy to pass time and dive into another adventure quickly.</p>
        <a href="/Users/anisamajhi/Documents/cs198-99/project1-AnisaMajhi/secret.html">Let me know your comic recommendations!</a>

        <h6>Tae Kwon Do</h6>
        <p>After practicing from the 4th grade, I earned my 3rd degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do. While 
            one of my toughest challenges, I've matured so much mentally and physically through the sport.
